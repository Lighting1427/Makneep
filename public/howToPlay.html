    <h1>How to Play Makneep</h1>

    <div class="how-to-play-container">
        <h2>Board and Piece Setup</h2>
        <p>
            The Makneep board consists of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each player has 8 pieces, totaling 16 pieces. The pieces are arranged on the bottom-most row of each player's side, directly opposite each other, filling all 8 squares from left to right.
        </p>

        <h2>Rules of Movement</h2>
        <p>
            1. Players can move only one piece at a time.<br>
            2. Pieces can move vertically or horizontally in four directions: up, down, left, and right, with no limit to the number of squares. However, they must move straight along the grid lines.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Movement Restrictions</strong><br>
            Pieces cannot move diagonally or jump over other pieces. Movement must stop immediately when blocked by another piece.
        </p>

        <h2>Rules for Capturing Opponent's Pieces</h2>
        <p>
            Capturing opponent pieces can be done in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Method 1: Use one piece to capture two opponent pieces; captured pieces are immediately removed.</li>
            <li>Method 2: Use 2-6 pieces to capture two opponent pieces; the captured pieces are removed immediately.</li>
            <li>Method 3: Capture occurs when pieces trap an opponent piece from both sides along the same line.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Winning Conditions</h2>
        <p>Players can win in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condition 1:</strong> Capture all opponent pieces; the player who captures all opponent pieces wins.</li>
            <li><strong>Condition 2:</strong> Trap the opponent so they cannot move; the trapped player loses.</li>
            <li><strong>Condition 3:</strong> If time runs out, the player with the most pieces remaining wins. If tied, the game is a draw.</li>
        </ul>
